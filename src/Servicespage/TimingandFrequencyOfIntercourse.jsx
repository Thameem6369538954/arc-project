          Many people want to conceive but are unable to do so due to several factors.
          There is a certain time when a woman is at her highest productive stage every month.
          If one tries to conceive during that time, there are higher chances that a woman will be able to conceive.
          Timing and frequency of intercourse can considerably affect the reproductive process and increase the chances of fertilization.
          It is advisable to always consult a professional. Doctors at ARC have extensive experience in reproductive concerns and will
          prove to be the best companion in solving all your infertility problems.

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            To increase your chances of conceiving, try to have intercourse two days before or on the day of ovulation.
            This is the most productive timeframe since there will be a healthy supply of sperm in your fallopian tube when eggs are released.
            However, many women are unaware of their ovulation timing. You can use an ovulation calculator, ovulation prediction kit,
            or observe symptoms like changes in basal body temperature and cervical mucus.
            Professional medical guidance can greatly assist in identifying your ovulation period accurately.

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The fertile window is determined by your menstrual cycle and the lifespan of your partnerâ€™s sperm and your eggs.
            Some believe reducing intercourse frequency increases sperm supply, but this is not always true.
            Couples with normal fertility conditions should increase intercourse frequency during the fertile window to boost conception chances.
            Despite frequent intercourse potentially reducing sperm count, consistent intercourse during the fertile window often increases
            the probability of conception.
