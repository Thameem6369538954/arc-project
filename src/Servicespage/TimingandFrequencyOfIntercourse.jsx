            Many people want to conceive but are unable to do so due to several factors. There is a certain time when a woman is at her highest
            productive stage every month. If one tries to conceive during that time, there are higher chances that a woman will be able to conceive.
            Timing and frequency of intercourse can considerably affect the reproductive process and increase the chances of fertilization. It is advisable to
            always consult a professional. Doctors at ARC have extensive experience in reproductive concerns and will prove to be the best companion in solving
            all your infertility problems.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            To increase your chances of conceiving, try to have intercourse two days before or on the day of ovulation. This is the most productive timeframe
            since there will be a healthy supply of sperm in your fallopian tube when eggs are released. However, many women are unaware of their ovulation timing.
            You can use an ovulation calculator, ovulation prediction kit, or observe symptoms like changes in basal body temperature and cervical mucus. Professional
            medical guidance can greatly assist in identifying your ovulation period accurately.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            The fertile window is determined by your menstrual cycle and the lifespan of your partnerâ€™s sperm and your eggs. Some believe reducing intercourse
            frequency increases sperm supply, but this is not always true. Couples with normal fertility conditions should increase intercourse frequency during the
            fertile window to boost conception chances. Despite frequent intercourse potentially reducing sperm count, consistent intercourse during the fertile window
            often increases the probability of conception.
