Most of the patients prefer to get themselves cured with the help of medicines or therapeutic activities only as they consider it to be safe. Surgeries also have positive results on patients but the after results may vary from one patient to another. There are several factors that affect patients after surgery like disfigurement or mutilation altering the body image, hormonal imbalances, damage to both vascular and nervous system, and increased pain. However, these symptoms are not consistent with every case. There are also some cases where the patients didnâ€™t feel any adverse after effects after the surgery and are living a normal healthy life today.",

At this stage, it becomes important for the other partner to take good care of the partner who has undergone surgery. The couple might not be able to indulge in sexual activities for few days or may be months, in some cases, if a partner has undergone a surgery. He will require time to adapt to the changes that have taken place within his body. Dyspareunia can be a major problem faced by the patient after surgery and it may disrupt the relationship between the two as the problem results in a lack of arousal which greatly affects an intercourse process.",
