          Stem cells are the building blocks of life. They are undifferentiated cells that can further differentiate into specialized types of cells. It is important to store your stem cells for future use in case of any chronic illness or infertility. Storing your own stem cells is faster, safer, and less costly than receiving anyone else's stem cell.
