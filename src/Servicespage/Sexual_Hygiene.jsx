            <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Wash and dry</span>
            <p>
              This is perhaps the most important and the most advised method of sexual hygiene. Always wash your genitals while you are in the shower. Form a rich lather with your soap and wash your genitals and your pubic region properly. Then wash the soap off thoroughly with water. Once your shower is over, dry your pubic region with a towel. Make sure that it is dried properly.

            <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Urinate after sex</span>
            <p>
              Whether men or women, it is advised that you urinate after sex. This helps to remove any toxins or bacteria that may have remained due to ejaculation in men and due to the semen released in women. The urine will remove all these from the urethra.

            <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Clean your underwear</span>
            <p>
              After shower or washing, it is better for your sexual hygiene that you use clean and dried underwear, rather than reusing the previously worn one. Underwears are a hotbed for bacteria and germs as it sits closely to our body and collects all the sweat released form the body. So change your underwear always after a bath.

            <p>
              Stand in front of a mirror and check your genitals thoroughly. You can even ask your intimate partner to check them for you. Check for any blisters, redness, warts or any unnatural phenomenon. If you notice anything unusual consult your doctor immediately.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Talk to your doctor</span>
            <p>
              Another good way to maintain a healthy sexual hygiene is to communicate with your doctor properly. Tell your doctor truthfully, about any unusual feeling that you may be experiencing in your genitals or something thatâ€™s been bothering you about your pubic region.
