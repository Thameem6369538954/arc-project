        It is an assisted reproductive technology. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) is a process in which sperm and eggs are fertilized outside of the human body. It begins with manually removing eggs from ovaries and mixing them with sperm in a lab in order to achieve fertilization. Fertilization takes several days to complete, resulting in a fertilized egg, known as an embryo, which is then implanted within the uterus. Upon attachment of the embryo to the uterine wall, pregnancy begins.        </p>
