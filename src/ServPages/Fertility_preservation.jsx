        Fertility preservation is a procedure by which people can retain their fertility and thus preserve their ability to reproduce. This process includes the preservation of reproductive tissue, sperm or egg so that it can be used later to produce biological children. Fertility is very beneficial in cancer patients as radiation, chemotherapy and surgical removal of reproductive organs can result in infertility in men. It is ideal to undergo fertility preservation before cancer treatment. This process is also beneficial in people having auto-immune diseases like lupus. People who are expecting to delay their plans of having children can opt for fertility preservation techniques.
