        Gestational carrying or gestational surrogacy is defined as an arrangement where a woman would carry and deliver the baby for another couple. The woman who would carry the baby is known as the gestational surrogate or carrier. The parents who would take the custody of the child are known as the intended parents. The gestational surrogate is not related to the baby. The egg comes either from the intended mother or the egg donor, while the sperm comes from the intended father or sperm donor. The donor embryos might also be used. In surrogacy, it might also be needed to have those eggs of one woman to be implanted in that of another’s uterus. <span className="text-blue-500 cursor-pointer hover:underline">ARC</span> is the perfect facility to help you with all these processes when you are in trouble.

        Gestational surrogacy is a very complex and emotional procedure and a very intense process. There will be a lot of time and money to be involved in the process.

        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <span className="font-bold">Medical test for the parents:</span> A medical test needs to be done to examine the genetic evaluation of the eggs and sperm.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <span className="font-bold">Medical tests for the gestational surrogate:</span> The surrogate will go through medical exams and drug screens, while her partner would need to undergo psychological screening.
        </li>
        <li>
