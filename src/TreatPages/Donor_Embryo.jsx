        There are thousands of couples who are struggling with their infertility problems. Most of the times the causes of infertility cannot even be explained. For all those who are misfortune enough to face such a situation in life, using donor embryos can be just the right option. Donor embryos are formed from the fusion of donated eggs and sperms and offer high chances of successful pregnancy among women who have infertility factors. This is a final step to be attempted who cannot get impregnated with in vitro fertilization. <span className="text-blue-500 cursor-pointer hover:underline">ARC</span> offers embryo donation programs that can help you with this process. The facility offers state-of-the-art technologies that can help you get done with the process easily.

        The costs of <span className="text-blue-500 cursor-pointer hover:underline">in vitro fertilization</span> are ridiculously high. And if there is a case of unexplained infertility, there might be chances that the process might have a lower rate of success. If in vitro fertilization does not work, there might not be many options left for the couple. The couple could go for the adoption of a child, but the other step could be that of using embryo donation. Though the chromosomes of the baby will not have the traits of its parents, the birth mother will have the chance of acting as the surrogate to the baby. Today thousands of babies are born by this technique if their parents are struggling with infertility.

        What are the Processes Involved in Embryo Donation?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Preimplantation genetic screening is performed on the gametes before they are used for implantation in the recipientâ€™s uterus. The screening process is also known as comprehensive chromosome screening. This technique would involve taking some cells from the blastocyst embryo. The acquired cells are then put through genetic analysis. The embryo is frozen while the test results are to be declared. The test results are necessary to determine if the embryo has the correct number of chromosomes. Also, it is checked if there are abnormalities in the chromosome of the embryo.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Chromosomal abnormalities, generally in their number, provide a significant barrier to the successful pregnancy. It often leads to miscarriages. Once this process is completed, the embryo can be used for implantation in the recipient once they apply. Thus genetically normal embryos with a specialized freezing technique called vitrification increase the success of pregnancy.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Although genetic screening does not remove all the cases of miscarriages, it certainly does increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.
