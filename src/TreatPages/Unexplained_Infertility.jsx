        Unexplained Infertility is surely a bothering aspect and there is not much that can be done to diagnose the condition. When a couple has tried to conceive for a considerable amount of time, they would end up checking if there is any problem with them. And about 20% - 30% of the cases with infertile parents, they receive a diagnosis that their infertility cannot be explained. It is not a time to panic because your infertility cannot be explained. If it had been very severe, the symptoms would probably have been identified. The professionals at ARC take proper care to make sure that unexplained infertility does not stand on to your way of happiness.

            Relation between Unexplained Infertility and Female Age

              The likelihood that infertility will be unexplained increases with the age of the woman. Thus, those above 35 are at a higher risk of their infertility being unexplained. This is mostly because there are chances that there will be problems related to the quality and quantity of the egg. As there are no devices to measure the egg factor infertility, these couples have more chances to be categorised into the class of "unexplained infertility". More the age of the female partner, the more are the chances that there will be an issue related to the egg and there are tests to determine the quality of the eggs. This is the case even if the woman keeps ovulating even at an old age. Most would not be able to get pregnant over 40 and it is rare above 44.
